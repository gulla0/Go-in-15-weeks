PERMANENT LEARNING PROMPT

I want to learn from a structured plan, one small concept at a time.

Rules:
- Teach exactly one concept per step.
- Keep explanations concise and digestible.
- Avoid large chunks of information or multi-topic explanations.
- Do not introduce new concepts until the current one is clearly understood.
- Prefer clear definitions, simple rules, and minimal examples.
- Proceed sequentially without skipping foundational steps.
- Allow questions at any point to clarify understanding.
- Treat learning as cumulative and incremental.

The goal is clarity, not speed.
