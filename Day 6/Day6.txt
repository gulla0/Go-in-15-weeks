DAY 6 — Concurrency Fundamentals (Goroutines & Channels)

* Concurrency is about dealing with multiple tasks at once; it is not the same as parallelism.
* Go’s concurrency model is built around **goroutines** and **channels**.

* A **goroutine** is a lightweight, managed thread.
* A goroutine is started using the `go` keyword: `go f()`.
* Goroutines run concurrently with the caller.
* The Go runtime schedules goroutines, not the OS.
* Creating thousands of goroutines is cheap compared to OS threads.

* The `main` goroutine exits when `main()` returns.
* When `main` exits, all other goroutines are terminated immediately.
* Programs must explicitly wait if background goroutines need to finish.

* A **channel** is a typed conduit for communication between goroutines.
* Channels are created with `make(chan T)`.
* Sending: `ch <- value`
* Receiving: `value := <-ch`
* Send and receive operations block by default.

* Blocking means:
  * Send blocks until another goroutine receives.
  * Receive blocks until another goroutine sends.

* Channels are used to **share data by communicating**, not by shared memory.
* This avoids many data-race problems.

* An **unbuffered channel** has no capacity.
* Communication happens only when both sender and receiver are ready.

* A **buffered channel** has capacity: `make(chan T, n)`.
* Sending blocks only when the buffer is full.
* Receiving blocks only when the buffer is empty.
* Buffered channels decouple sender and receiver timing.

* Channels have a direction:
  * `chan T` — send and receive
  * `chan<- T` — send-only
  * `<-chan T` — receive-only
* Directional channels are used to restrict API usage.

* Closing a channel signals that no more values will be sent.
* `close(ch)` can only be called by the sender.
* Receiving from a closed channel yields zero values after buffer drain.
* The “comma ok” form detects closure: `v, ok := <-ch`.

* Channels should not be used like queues unless clearly intended.
* Do not close a channel from the receiver side.
* Do not send on a closed channel (runtime panic).

* Goroutines define concurrency.
* Channels define synchronization and communication.
* Correct Go concurrency relies on clear ownership and communication rules.
