DAY 4 — Maps and Zero Values

Goal: Learn how Go represents key–value data and how zero values affect program correctness.

---

1. What a Map Is

* A map is a built-in key–value data structure.
* Keys must be comparable types (e.g. string, int).
* Values can be any type.
* Map syntax: map[K]V

Example:
map[string]int

---

2. Declaring and Creating Maps

* A map must be created before use.
* A nil map cannot store values.

Valid ways to create maps:
* make(map[string]int)
* map[string]int{}

Invalid:
* var m map[string]int  (nil until make)

Rule:
A map must be initialized before writing to it.

---

3. Reading From a Map

* Reading a missing key does NOT panic.
* Missing keys return the zero value of the value type.

Example:
m["x"] returns 0 if value type is int.

Important:
You cannot tell if the key existed just from the value.

---

4. The “Comma ok” Pattern

* Used to distinguish “missing key” from “zero value”.
* Syntax:
value, ok := m[key]

Rules:
* ok == true → key exists
* ok == false → key does not exist

This is mandatory when correctness depends on key presence.

---

5. Writing to a Map

* Assigning to a key inserts or overwrites.
* There is no append; assignment is the only write operation.

Example:
m["a"] = 10

If the key already exists, the value is replaced.

---

6. Deleting From a Map

* delete(m, key) removes a key.
* Deleting a missing key is safe (no error).

delete(m, "x") is always valid.

---

7. Iterating Over a Map

* Use range to iterate.
* Order is NOT guaranteed.
* Never rely on iteration order.

Syntax:
for k, v := range m { ... }

Rule:
Map iteration order is intentionally randomized.

---

8. Maps Are Reference Types

* Passing a map to a function does NOT copy its contents.
* All references point to the same underlying data.

Rule:
You do NOT need pointers to modify a map.

This is different from structs.

---

9. Zero Value of a Map

* The zero value of a map is nil.
* nil maps can be read from but not written to.

Rule:
Always initialize maps before writing.

---

10. When to Use Maps vs Slices

Use a map when:
* You need fast lookup by key
* Order does not matter
* Keys are meaningful identifiers

Use a slice when:
* Order matters
* You need indexed iteration
* Duplicates are allowed
